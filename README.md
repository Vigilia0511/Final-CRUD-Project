# Library Management System

## Project Description
This is a simple Library Management System developed as a school project for BSIT 3A. The application is built using Java Swing for the GUI and MySQL for the database. It allows users to manage books, members, and book borrowings in a library.

## Features
- **Books Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search books by ID, title, author, or genre.
- **Members Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search library members.
- **Borrowings Management**: Record book borrowings and returns, with due date tracking.
- **Reports**: Generate reports on books, members, and borrowings.

## Technologies Used
- Java (Swing for GUI)
- MySQL Database
- JDBC for database connectivity

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Set up a MySQL database and import the `library_db.sql` file to create the necessary tables.
3. Update the database connection details in `LibraryManagementSystem.java` if needed (URL, USER, PASSWORD).
4. Compile and run the `LibraryManagementSystem.java` file.

## Database Setup
- Create a MySQL database named `library_db`.
- Run the SQL script in `library_db.sql` to set up the tables.
